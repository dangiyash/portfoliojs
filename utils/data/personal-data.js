  description: "Hi, I am Yash, I like to design, create, and deploy, I am a creative developer, apart from developing websites and creating webapps I like to learn new things, solve challenging problems, explore secrets and reading books. I prefer developing through MERN stack but I like to learn new useful technologies, that can both boost my creativity as well as reducing deployment times and making the process more fun, easy and structured. I like to bring new creative ideas on the table most of the times, mostly disagreeable, but interesting to learn about!",
